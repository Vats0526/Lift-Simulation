# Lift-Simulation
Created a web application that simulates the mechanics of elevators (lifts) for our client. The app will provide a user-friendly interface where the client can input the number of floors and elevators they want to simulate.

1. The web page will feature an input section where the user can specify the number of floors and lifts(limit as mentioned) they want to work with.
2. After the user provides the input, the web app will generate an interactive user interface. This interface will visually display the lifts (elevators) and buttons on each floor.
3. When the user clicks a button on a particular floor, the lift movement will be prioritized based on the set criteria.
